the muse (1999 film)the muse is a 1999 film starring albert brooks and sharon stone, directed by brooks. ==plot== after winning a lifetime achievement award, esteemed screenwriter steven phillips (brooks) has a rude awakening. steven believes the award has no real meaning, but it does—it means his career is over. his studio has reneged on his contract and told him he's gone cold, saying he's "lost his edge." a junior exec (mark feuerstein) tells steven his new script is dull and to be off the lot by 5 p.m. taken by surprise, the oscar-nominated writer is desperate to revive his career. he seeks the advice of a very successful screenwriter buddy, jack (jeff bridges), who arranges an introduction to sarah (stone), a modern day muse who can inspire anyone. sarah, however, has conditions and unnecessarily lavish needs, such as expensive hotel rooms and gifts from tiffany  co. steven is forced to make good on those conditions, much to the chagrin of his wife laura (andie macdowell). steven isn't sure if the muse could be the real thing or just somebody sucking him dry of his money and patience. she takes him to long beach, where they encounter writer-director rob reiner, someone sarah clearly knows. steven gets an idea for a movie set in an aquarium. as sarah's demands increase, steven's apprehensive wife begins to be won over. through the muse's encouragement laura decides to pursue her dream of baking and selling cookies, to much fanfare and success. to save money, sarah is invited by the phillipses to move into their house. steven, however, is frustrated because sarah spends more time helping others—notably hollywood writers and directors like james cameron and martin scorsese, who come to steven's house to see her. steven even surrenders his own bedroom to sarah and sleeps in the guest house. when he pleads for a way to end his aquarium screenplay, sarah does point steven in the right direction and inspires him with a great idea. steven's agent hal is thrilled and urges him to finish the script as quickly as possible. the following morning, though, two visitors come to steven's home, revealing that they are doctors from a mental clinic. they tell steven that sarah is an escaped psychiatric patient from their asylum who has multiple personality disorder. they find the whole "muse" idea hilarious. when they try to find sarah to take her back, they discover that she has escaped. the junior exec, josh, loves steven's script, but he breaks the news that the idea is already in production at another studio—by rob reiner. a broken-hearted steven goes to work in his wife's new cookie business. things turn around when the agent calls to inform steven that the reiner project fell through and the studio wants to purchase his version, contingent upon a few changes being made. an excited steven goes to the studio, where a secretary reveals that a new boss, christine, is now in charge. christine is revealed to be sarah. she takes steven's arm and insists that they discuss the changes over a nice, expensive lunch, which she expects him to pay for. ==cast== * albert brooks as steven phillips * sharon stone as sarah little * andie macdowell as laura phillips * jeff bridges as jack warrick * mark feuerstein as josh martin * bradley whitford as hal * steven wright as stan spielberg * jennifer tilly as herself * rob reiner as himself * wolfgang puck as himself * james cameron as himself * martin scorsese as himself * lorenzo lamas as himself ==soundtrack== pop rock musician elton john composed the soundtrack for the muse. ==reception== the muse was a slight box office flop, grossing about $11 million domestically on an estimated budget of $15 million. the film did relatively poorly at the box office as compared to brooks' other films such as defending your life (1991), which made $16 million, and mother (1996), which made $19 million. critical reception for the film was also low. most notable critics who were fans of the film included leonard maltin, roger ebert, and desson howe. ==bid for a golden globe nomination for sharon stone== in 1999, helmut voss, then president of the hollywood foreign press association, who give the annual golden globe awards, ordered all 82 of its members to return gift luxury watches sent by either sharon stone or usa/october films (now merged into focus features). the luxury watches were considered promotions for a nomination for stone's performance in this film. according to variety, voss ordered the return of the gifts "to protect the integrity of its award". stone got the nomination for best actress in a motion picture musical or comedy, but lost to janet mcteer for tumbleweeds. ==see also== * the muse soundtrack, by elton john. ==references== == external links ==

extremities (film)extremities is a 1986 film starring farrah fawcett, alfre woodard, diana scarwid and james russo. it was adapted from the successful, yet controversial, 1982 off-broadway play of the same name by william mastrosimone. farrah fawcett had also appeared in the play to great critical acclaim, taking over a role originated by susan sarandon. james russo also appeared in the play as the attacker. ==plot== marjorie (farrah fawcett) is a young woman who works in a museum and lives with two female roommates, pat (woodard) and terry (scarwid). one night, while getting into her car, she is attacked at knifepoint by a masked assailant (russo). marjorie manages to escape, but not before the mugger makes off with her purse. she goes to the police but is told there is very little they can do. one week later, while marjorie's roommates are at work, her nightmare comes true as the assailant (named joe) casually enters her house, having used her personal information to find out where she lives. a terrifying scene of events unfolds as joe subjects marjorie to a continuous barrage of mental and physical assaults. the tables finally turn, however, when marjorie overpowers joe by spraying his eyes and mouth with insect repellent as he's getting ready to rape her. marjorie then ties joe up and subjects him to the same kind of physical and mental assaults he used on her earlier, even reducing him to tears as he pleads for his life when he learns that he's ingested some of the insect repellent marjorie sprayed at him. when terry and pat return home, they try to convince marjorie, who is contemplating murdering him, to think about the consequences of her actions, since joe didn't actually rape or attempt to kill her. joe points this out when he compares his beaten and bloodied self to marjorie's own physical state. he attempts to fabricate a story that he knew marjorie through a one-night stand at a party some time ago, which her roommates almost believe, until marjorie calls him a liar and attacks him, finding the sheath knife he used on her in the first attack, proving her story to patty and terry. marjorie forces joe to admit his guilt by torturing him with the blade, and at one point threatens to castrate him if he does not tell the truth. defeated, a sobbing joe confesses by saying he watched the house and stole letters to gain insight into how the women lived...and that he intended to kill marjorie and her roommates that day. he also confesses to the rapes and presumed murders of three other women. finally at peace, marjorie allows patty and terry to call the police. ==cast== *farrah fawcett as marjorie *james russo as joe *alfre woodard as pat *diana scarwid as terry *sandy martin as officer sudow *eddie velez as officer #1 *tom everett as officer #2 *donna lynn leavy as woman on phone (voice) *enid kent as mother at police station *michael hennessy as pizza man *danika hendrickson as joe's daughter *clare wren as racquetball player *james avery as security guard ==award nomination== for her performance, fawcett received a 1986 golden globe nomination for best actress in a film drama". ==see also== * extremities (play) ==external links== *review at tv guide
